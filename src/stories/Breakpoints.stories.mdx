# Core concepts

The core concept is based on [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/breakpoints/#core-concepts):

-   Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.
-   Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.
-   Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.

# Available breakpoints

| Breakpoint        | Class infix | Dimensions |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| X-Small           | None        | <576px     |
| Small             | sm          | ≥576px     |
| Medium            | md          | ≥768px     |
| Large             | lg          | ≥992px     |
| Extra large       | xl          | ≥1200px    |
| Extra extra large | xxl         | ≥1400px    |

# Min-width

The UIKIT primarily uses the following media query ranges—or breakpoints—in our source Sass files for our layout, grid system, and components.

```css
// Source mixins

// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    ...;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    ...;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    ...;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) {
    ...;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(xxl) {
    ...;
}

// Usage

// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint
.custom-class {
    display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    .custom-class {
        display: block;
    }
}
```

These Sass mixins translate in our compiled CSS using the values declared in our Sass variables. For example:

```css
// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) {
    ...;
}

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    ...;
}

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) {
    ...;
}

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    ...;
}

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)
@media (min-width: 1400px) {
    ...;
}
```
